### Explanation for `temp` directory.

It is like a playground.

No need to worry the important data and models used in other notebook will be re-write, appended, or changed by some running error.

- The **raw data** are saved in `raw_data` directory.

- The **cleaned data** are saved in `data` directory, which will be used by other .ipynb files.

- The **fitted models** are saved in `models` directory.

- The **dataset and models created in this notebook** are saved in `temp/data` directory. Because we assumed you run this code only for checking the code, It is a temp directory, saving temporary data and models.
